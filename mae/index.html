                    <p>Some of my favorite memories come from my involvement in JROTC, especially during Raiders and Drill. Being involved in these extracurricular activities has helped me build strong connections with upperclassmen. Raider Nationals and the JROTC Ball were some of the best experiences I've ever had.</p>

                            <p>Blue Springs South is a very good AFJROTC school and is very committed to the success of the drill team. Most of our meets we are in the top 3, if not 1st place.</p>
                            <p>It's a very formal event, all about exhibiting ordered discipline and looking good while doing it.</p>
                            <p>I command my team in Unarmed Regulation Drill.</p>

                            <p>I traveled to Georgia to compete in Raider Nationals, where I competed in every event and placed 3rd overall in the women's division.</p>
                            <p>Last year, drill and Raiders consisted of overnight trips before our meets and those overnight trips gave me the opportunity to bond with some of the upperclassmen over little things such as talking in the bathroom at night or playing card games before going to bed.</p>

                    <h3>Raider Events</h3>
                    <p>At Raider Nationals, I competed in several challenging events:</p>

                    <!-- 5K Mountain Run -->
                    <div class="collapsible">
                        <button class="collapsible-btn">
                            <span class="event-title">5K Mountain Run</span>
                            <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
                        </button>
                        <div class="collapsible-content">
                            <p>This was an intense outdoor race up a huge incline! We had to navigate around obstacles, roots, trees, and big rocks along the trail. One of the helpers at the competition accidentally pointed us in the wrong direction, so I ended up running down a steep hill and then back up another one before we realized the mistake. Getting back on track meant climbing back up on all fours – it was tough but definitely built character!</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <!-- 1-Rope Bridge -->
                    <div class="collapsible">

                        </button>
                        <div class="collapsible-content">
                            <p>This event was all about teamwork and speed! One person ties the rope around a tree on one side, and another runs it across to the far side. Once it's secured tight, we clip ourselves on with a carabiner and pull ourselves across as fast as we can. Only three people can be on the rope at once, so timing is everything. At Nationals, the rope dipped so low that my back actually touched the flowing river water below – definitely an unforgettable experience!</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <!-- PTT -->

                        <div class="collapsible-content">
                            <p>This was probably the most intense obstacle course ever! We had to crawl through tunnels, sprint to grab two water jugs weighing about 40 pounds each, hurdle over a 4-foot wall, jump over a table platform, then navigate through a maze to reach a large canoe. Then we dragged the canoe to a marker and back. But wait – that's only halfway! We had to complete every single obstacle again in reverse to get back to the start. My arms were definitely feeling it after this one!</p>

                    <!-- Ruck and Litter Rescue -->

                        <div class="collapsible-content">
                            <p>This event tested our teamwork and endurance big time! We had a platform (the "litter") with 100 pounds of weight on it and rope handles at each corner. With our team of 10, four of us would carry the litter while running, and when someone got tired, another teammate would jump in to relieve them. Meanwhile, six teammates carried 40-pound rucks on their backs. First, we ran to a 9-foot wall and had to climb it with our rucks still on! Then we picked up the litter and ran through neck-deep water. After that, we had to carry all the equipment for 1.5 miles to the finish. It was exhausting but amazing to see how well we worked together!</p>

                            <p>The Gauntlet was a multi-stage challenge that kept us on our toes! We started by having two people jump through tires. Then we had to push rucks and weighted box crates through obstacles and run with them to a 9-foot wall. After climbing the wall (again!), we ran through two different tunnels before finally crossing the finish line. Each part of the course tested different skills, and it really showed the importance of staying focused and energized throughout the entire event!</p>

                    <p>When I was 5 or 6 years old, I decided to teach myself how to ride a bike without the training wheels on a dirt road. I would continuously fall and I scraped my knees, hands, and elbows until they bled but I would not stop until I got the hang of it. When I went back into the house, I told Grandpa, "I learned how to ride a bike! And I need a band aid."</p>
                    <p>When I was in 3rd and 4th grade, I joined a Circus Skills club that was offered at school. I taught myself how to ride a unicycle and to juggle bean bags and various other objects.</p>
