                <p>I love visiting my dad's house on the weekends because I like eating his yummy steaks and food. I get to hang out with dad and my siblings all together, watch movies, and spend quality time with my dad. I really love my dad's big yard because there's always so much to do outside with all the space we have, and we can go play at the lake too!</p>
                <p>I like hanging out with mom because we talk about how things are going for us, and I like to tell her how things are going at school. We also talk about things that we like. She talks to me and Mae about her coupon shopping that she's excited about!</p>

                <li><strong>Major</strong> - Our 18-year-old white lab. We fostered him when he was 9 years old from my Aunt Amber after she passed away. I learned how to take care of him by myself - I take him for walks, feed him, and clean up after his messes in the yard.</li>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite memories and special moments from my life so far!</p>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <h3>Living with Grandparents in Stockton, MO</h3>
                <p>I always played with chalk on the driveway, which was so much fun! I would watch movies with Mae and Ryan a lot. We did planks and push-ups with Dad to stay fit during COVID. I loved trying to use a hula-hoop or a jump-rope, even though I wasn't very good at it!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <h3>Pumpkin Patch Adventure</h3>
                <p>We went to a pumpkin patch in the fall and there was a pumpkin catapult that they allowed us to trigger. I was leaning forward in the wrong place when I pulled the trigger and the catapult whacked me right in the face! I was okay but it was scary.</p>
                <p>We also got to pet kittens, goats, and puppies too. We got to pick out our own pumpkin and we did other fun games like pumpkin bowling and a corn maze.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <h3>Japanese Cousin Visits America</h3>
                <p>My Japanese cousin, Izumi, visited us from Japan by surprise! She brought us special snacks from Japan that were super tasty. We had to communicate using Google Translate, which was very fun because we would joke and laugh and tease Daeron too.</p>
                <p>She would use silly face filters on me, so I did it back to her for fun!</p>

                <button class="photo-toggle" onclick="togglePhoto('izumi')">Show photos with Izumi</button>

                <h3>Christmas with Grandparents</h3>
                <p>I loved going to visit my grandparents for Christmas because grandma always knew how to make a great Christmas meal. I loved petting her two dogs too: Thor (a German Shepherd) and Freya (a huge Malamute).</p>
                <p>The decorations at grandma's house are always so pretty!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <h3>My 11th Birthday Party (with Dad)</h3>
                <p>I got to invite my very special friends and I was so happy that they came! We ran around a lot. The cake was good, the food was good, and I climbed a tree.</p>
                <p>It was special to me because I was able to help plan this one instead of it being planned for me.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <h3>My 9th Birthday Party (with Mom)</h3>
                <p>I learned how to roller skate at Rink Rats! One of my friends there taught me how to sketch and draw.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <h3>Meeting My Softball Friends</h3>
                <p>Dad signed me up to play softball and I was so happy! We would play around so much. The first two weeks, I couldn't remember their names, but then I got used to them and remembered. We would have so much fun, but we did have our serious moments while practicing too.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="memory-card">
                <h3>Joining Franklin Smith Elementary</h3>
                <p>What I liked about starting school here was how everybody would make me feel welcome. We would be assigned "building jobs" where we had the chance to be responsible and help out around the school building.</p>
                <p>The teachers there were very very nice to me and I made lots of friends there!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>My Favorite Teachers</h3>
